<p>Thereupon the lad, Kullervo,<br/>
Laid his luncheon in his basket,<br/>
Drove the herd to mountain-pastures,<br/>
O’er the hills and through the marshes,<br/>
To their grazings in the woodlands,<br/>
Speaking as he careless wandered:<br/>
“Of the youth am I the poorest,<br/>
Hapless lad and full of trouble,<br/>
Evil luck to me befallen!<br/>
I alas! must idly wander<br/>
O’er the hills and through the valleys,<br/>
As a watch-dog for the cattle!”<br/>
Then she sat upon the greensward,<br/>
In a sunny spot selected,<br/>
Singing, chanting words as follow:<br/>
“Shine, O shine, thou Sun of heaven,<br/>
Cast thy rays, thou fire of Ukko,<br/>
On the herdsman of the blacksmith,<br/>
On the head of Kullerwoinen,<br/>
On this poor and luckless shepherd,<br/>
Not in Ilmarinen’s smithy,<br/>
Nor the dwellings of his people;<br/>
Good the table of the hostess,<br/>
Cuts the best of wheaten biscuit,<br/>
Honey-cakes she cuts in slices,<br/>
Spreading each with golden butter;<br/>
Only dry bread has the herdsman,<br/>
Eats with pain the oaten bread-crusts,’<br/>
Filled with chaff his and biscuit,<br/>
Feeds upon the worst of straw-bread,<br/>
Pine-tree bark, the broad he feeds on,<br/>
Sipping water from the birch-bark,<br/>
Drinking from the tips of grasses I<br/>
Go, O Sun, and go, O barley,<br/>
Haste away, thou light of Ukko,<br/>
Hide within the mountain pine-trees,<br/>
Go, O wheat, to yonder thickets,<br/>
To the trees of purple berries,<br/>
To the junipers and alders,<br/>
Safely lead the herdsman homeward<br/>
To the biscuit golden-buttered,<br/>
To the honeyed cakes and viands!”<br/>
While the shepherd lad was singing<br/>
Kullerwoinen’s song and echo,<br/>
Ilmarinen’s wife was feasting<br/>
On the sweetest bread of Northland,<br/>
On the toothsome cakes of barley,<br/>
On the richest of provisions;<br/>
Only laid aside some cabbage,<br/>
For the herdsman, Kullerwoinen;<br/>
Set apart some wasted fragments,<br/>
Leavings of the dogs at dinner,<br/>
For the shepherd, home returning.<br/>
From the woods a bird came flying,<br/>
Sang this song to Kullerwoinen:<br/>
“’Tis the time for forest-dinners,<br/>
For the fatherless companion<br/>
Of the herds to eat his viands,<br/>
Eat the good things from his basket!”<br/>
Kullerwoinen heard the songster,<br/>
Looked upon the Sun’s long shadow,<br/>
Straightway spake the words that follow:<br/>
“True, the singing of the song-bird,<br/>
It is time indeed for feasting,<br/>
Time to eat my basket-dinner.”<br/>
Thereupon young Kullerwoinen<br/>
Called his herd to rest in safety,<br/>
Sat upon a grassy hillock,<br/>
Took his basket from his shoulders,<br/>
Took therefrom the arid oat-loaf,<br/>
Turned it over in his fingers,<br/>
Carefully the loaf inspected,<br/>
Spake these words of ancient wisdom:<br/>
“Many loaves are fine to look on,<br/>
On the outside seem delicious,<br/>
On the inside, chaff and tan-bark!”<br/>
Then the shepherd, Kullerwoinen,<br/>
Drew his knife to cut his oat-loaf,<br/>
Cut the hard and arid biscuit;<br/>
Cuts against a stone imprisoned,<br/>
Well imbedded in the centre,<br/>
Breaks his ancient knife in pieces;<br/>
When the shepherd youth, Kullervo,<br/>
Saw his magic knife had broken,<br/>
Weeping sore, he spake as follows:<br/>
“This, the blade that I bold sacred,<br/>
This the one thing that I honor,<br/>
Relic of my mother’s people!<br/>
On the stone within this oat-loaf,<br/>
On this cheat-cake of the hostess,<br/>
I my precious knife have broken.<br/>
How shall I repay this insult,<br/>
How avenge this woman’s malice,<br/>
What the wages for deception?”<br/>
From a tree the raven answered:<br/>
“O thou little silver buckle,<br/>
Only son of old Kalervo,<br/>
Why art thou in evil humor,<br/>
Wherefore sad in thy demeanor?<br/>
Take a young shoot from the thicket,<br/>
Take a birch-rod from the valley,<br/>
Drive thy herd across the lowlands,<br/>
Through the quicksands of the marshes;<br/>
To the wolves let one half wander,<br/>
To the bear-dens, lead the other;<br/>
Sing the forest wolves together,<br/>
Sing the bears down from the mountains,<br/>
Call the wolves thy little children,<br/>
And the bears thy standard-bearers;<br/>
Drive them like a cow-herd homeward,<br/>
Drive them home like spotted cattle,<br/>
Drive them to thy master’s milk-yards;<br/>
Thus thou wilt repay the hostess<br/>
For her malice and derision.”<br/>
Thereupon the wizard answered,<br/>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br/>
“Wait, yea wait, thou bride of Hisi!<br/>
Do I mourn my mother’s relic,<br/>
Mourn the keep-sake thou hast broken?<br/>
Thou thyself shalt mourn as sorely<br/>
When thy, cows come home at evening!”<br/>
From the tree he cuts a birch-wand,<br/>
From the juniper a whip-stick,<br/>
Drives the herd across the lowlands,<br/>
Through the quicksands of the marshes,<br/>
To the wolves lets one half wander,<br/>
To the bear-dens leads the other;<br/>
Calls the wolves his little children,<br/>
Calls the bears his standard-bearers,<br/>
Changes all his herd of cattle<br/>
Into wolves and bears by magic.<br/>
In the west the Sun is shining,<br/>
Telling that the night is coming.<br/>
Quick the wizard, Kullerwoinen,<br/>
Wanders o’er the pine-tree mountain,<br/>
Hastens through the forest homeward,<br/>
Drives the wolves and bears before him<br/>
Toward the milk-yards of the hostess;<br/>
To the herd he speaks as follows,<br/>
As they journey on together:<br/>
“Tear and kill the wicked hostess,<br/>
Tear her guilty flesh in pieces,<br/>
When she comes to view her cattle,<br/>
When she stoops to do her milking!”<br/>
Then the wizard, Kullerwoinen,<br/>
From an ox-bone makes a bugle,<br/>
Makes it from Tuonikki’s cow-horn,<br/>
Makes a flute from Kiryo’s shin-bone,<br/>
Plays a song upon his bugle,<br/>
Plays upon his flute of magic,<br/>
Thrice upon the home-land hill-tops,<br/>
Six times near the coming gate-ways.<br/>
Ilmarinen’s wife and hostess<br/>
Long had waited for the coming<br/>
Of her herd with Kullerwoinen,<br/>
Waited for the milk at evening,<br/>
Waited for the new-made butter,<br/>
Heard the footsteps in the cow-path,<br/>
On the heath she beard the bustle,<br/>
Spake these joyous words of welcome:<br/>
“Be thou praised, O gracious Ukko,<br/>
That my herd is home returning!<br/>
But I hear a bugle sounding,<br/>
’Tis the playing of my herdsman,<br/>
Playing on a magic cow-horn,<br/>
Bursting all our ears with music!”<br/>
Kullerwoinen, drawing nearer,<br/>
To the hostess spake as follows:<br/>
“Found the bugle in the woodlands,<br/>
And the flute among the rushes;<br/>
All thy herd are in the passage,<br/>
All thy cows within the hurdles,<br/>
This the time to build the camp-fire,<br/>
This the time to do the milking!”<br/>
Ilmarinen’s wife, the hostess,<br/>
Thus addressed an aged servant:<br/>
“Go, thou old one, to the milking,<br/>
Have the care of all my cattle,<br/>
Do not ask for mine assistance,<br/>
Since I have to knead the biscuit.”<br/>
Kullerwoinen spake as follows:<br/>
“Always does the worthy hostess,<br/>
Ever does the wisdom-mother<br/>
Go herself and do the milking,<br/>
Tend the cows within the hurdles!”<br/>
Then the wife of Ilmarinen<br/>
Built a field-fire in the passage,<br/>
Went to milk her cows awaiting,<br/>
Looked upon her herd in wonder,<br/>
Spake these happy words of greeting:<br/>
“Beautiful, my herd of cattle,<br/>
Glistening like the skins of lynxes,<br/>
Hair as soft as fur of ermine,<br/>
Peaceful waiting for the milk-pail!”<br/>
On the milk-stool sits the hostess,<br/>
Milks one moment, then a second,<br/>
Then a third time milks and ceases;<br/>
When the bloody wolves disguising,<br/>
Quick attack the hostess milking,<br/>
And the bears lend their assistance,<br/>
Tear and mutilate her body<br/>
With their teeth and sharpened fingers.<br/>
Kullerwoinen, cruel wizard,<br/>
Thus repaid the wicked hostess,<br/>
Thus repaid her evil treatment.<br/>
Quick the wife of Ilmarinen<br/>
Cried aloud in bitter anguish,<br/>
Thus addressed the youth, Kullervo:<br/>
“Evil son, thou bloody herdsman,<br/>
Thou hast brought me wolves in malice,<br/>
Driven bears within my hurdles!<br/>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br/>
“Have I evil done as shepherd,<br/>
Worse the conduct of the hostess;<br/>
Baked a stone inside my oat-cake,<br/>
On the inside, rock and tan-bark,<br/>
On the stone my knife, was broken,<br/>
Treasure of my mother’s household,<br/>
Broken virtue of my people!”<br/>
Ilmarinen’s wife made answer:<br/>
“Noble herdsman, Kullerwoinen,<br/>
Change, I pray thee, thine opinion,<br/>
Take away thine incantations,<br/>
From the bears and wolves release me,<br/>
Save me from this spell of torture<br/>
I will give thee better raiment,<br/>
Give the best of milk and butter,<br/>
Set for thee the sweetest table;<br/>
Thou shalt live with me in welcome,<br/>
Need not labor for thy keeping.<br/>
If thou dost not free me quickly,<br/>
Dost not break this spell of magic,<br/>
I shall sink into the Death-land,<br/>
Shall return to Tuonela.”<br/>
This is Kullerwoinen’s answer:<br/>
“It is best that thou shouldst perish,<br/>
Let destruction overtake thee,<br/>
There is ample room in Mana,<br/>
Room for all the dead in Kalma,<br/>
There the worthiest must slumber,<br/>
There must rest the good and evil.”<br/>
Ilmarinen’s wife made answer:<br/>
“Ukko, thou O God in heaven,<br/>
Span the strongest of thy cross-bows,<br/>
Test the weapon by thy wisdom,<br/>
Lay an arrow forged from copper,<br/>
On the cross-bow of thy forging;<br/>
Rightly aim thy flaming arrow,<br/>
With thy magic hurl the missile,<br/>
Shoot this wizard through the vitals,<br/>
Pierce the heart of Kullerwoinen<br/>
With the lightning of the heavens,<br/>
With thine arrows tipped with copper.”<br/>
Kullerwoinen prays as follows:<br/>
“Ukko, God of truth and justice.<br/>
Do not slay thy magic servant,<br/>
Slay the wife of Ilmarinen,<br/>
Kill in her the worst of women,<br/>
In these hurdles let her perish,<br/>
Lest she wander hence in freedom,<br/>
To perform some other mischief,<br/>
Do some greater deed of malice!”<br/>
Quick as lightning fell the hostess,<br/>
Quick the wife of Ilmarinen<br/>
Fell and perished in the hurdles,<br/>
On the ground before her cottage<br/>
Thus the death of Northland’s hostess,<br/>
Cherished wife of Ilmarinen,<br/>
Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br/>
Wooed and watched for many summers,<br/>
Pride and joy of Kalevala!</p>
