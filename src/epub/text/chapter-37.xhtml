<p>Ilmarinen, metal-worker,<br/>
Wept one day, and then a second,<br/>
Wept the third from morn till evening,<br/>
O’er the death of his companion,<br/>
Once the Maiden of the Rainbow;<br/>
Did not swing his heavy hammer,<br/>
Did not touch its copper handle,<br/>
Made no sound within his smithy,<br/>
Made no blow upon his anvil,<br/>
Till three months had circled over;<br/>
Then the blacksmith spake as follows:<br/>
“Woe is me, unhappy hero!<br/>
Do not know how I can prosper;<br/>
Long the days, and cold, and dreary,<br/>
Longer still the nights, and colder;<br/>
I am weary in the evening,<br/>
In the morning still am weary,<br/>
Have no longing for the morning,<br/>
And the evening is unwelcome;<br/>
Have no pleasure in the future,<br/>
All my pleasures gone forever,<br/>
With my faithful life-companion<br/>
Slaughtered by the hand of witchcraft!<br/>
Often will my heart-strings quiver<br/>
When I rest within my chamber,<br/>
When I wake at dreamy midnight,<br/>
Half-unconscious, vainly searching<br/>
For my noble wife departed.”<br/>
Wifeless lived the mourning blacksmith,<br/>
Altered in his form and features;<br/>
Wept one month and then another,<br/>
Wept three months in full succession.<br/>
Then the magic metal-worker<br/>
Gathered gold from deeps of ocean,<br/>
Gathered silver from the mountains,<br/>
Gathered many heaps of birch-wood.<br/>
Filled with faggots thirty sledges,<br/>
Burned the birch-wood into ashes,<br/>
Put the ashes in the furnace,<br/>
Laid the gold upon the embers,<br/>
Lengthwise laid a piece of silver<br/>
Of the size of lambs in autumn,<br/>
Or the fleet-foot hare in winter;<br/>
Places servants at the bellows,<br/>
Thus to melt the magic metals.<br/>
Eagerly the servants labor,<br/>
Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<br/>
Fan the flames within the furnace.<br/>
Ilmarinen, magic blacksmith,<br/>
Works unceasing at his forging,<br/>
Thus to mould a golden image,<br/>
Mould a bride from gold and silver;<br/>
But the workmen fail their master,<br/>
Faithless stand they at the bellows.<br/>
Wow the artist, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Fans the flame with force of magic,<br/>
Blows one day, and then a second,<br/>
Blows the third from morn till even;<br/>
Then he looks within the furnace,<br/>
Looks around the oven-border,<br/>
Hoping there to see an image<br/>
Rising from the molten metals.<br/>
Comes a lambkin from the furnace,<br/>
Rising from the fire of magic,<br/>
Wearing hair of gold and copper,<br/>
Laced with many threads of silver;<br/>
All rejoice but Ilmarinen<br/>
At the beauty of the image.<br/>
This the language of the blacksmith:<br/>
“May the wolf admire thy graces;<br/>
I desire a bride of beauty<br/>
Born from molten gold and silver!”<br/>
Ilmarinen, the magician,<br/>
To the furnace threw the lambkin;<br/>
Added gold in great abundance,<br/>
And increased the mass of silver,<br/>
Added other magic metals,<br/>
Set the workmen at the bellows;<br/>
Zealously the servants labor,<br/>
Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<br/>
Fan the flames within the furnace.<br/>
Ilmarinen, wizard-forgeman,<br/>
Works unceasing with his metals,<br/>
Moulding well a golden image,<br/>
Wife of molten gold and silver;<br/>
But the workmen fail their master,<br/>
Faithless do they ply the bellows.<br/>
Now the artist, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Fans the flames by force of magic;<br/>
Blows one day, and then a second,<br/>
Blows a third from morn till evening,<br/>
When he looks within the furnace,<br/>
Looks around the oven-border,<br/>
Hoping there, to see an image<br/>
Rising from the molten metals.<br/>
From the flames a colt arises,<br/>
Golden-maned and silver-headed,<br/>
Hoofs are formed of shining copper.<br/>
All rejoice but Ilmarinen<br/>
At the wonderful creation;<br/>
This the language of the blacksmith;<br/>
“Let the bears admire thy graces;<br/>
I desire a bride of beauty<br/>
Born of many magic metals.”<br/>
Thereupon the wonder-forger<br/>
Drives the colt back to the furnace,<br/>
Adds a greater mass of silver,<br/>
And of gold the rightful measure,<br/>
Sets the workmen at the bellows.<br/>
Eagerly the servants labor,<br/>
Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<br/>
Fan the flames within the furnace.<br/>
Ilmarinen, the magician,<br/>
Works unceasing at his witchcraft,<br/>
Moulding well a golden maiden,<br/>
Bride of molten gold and silver;<br/>
But the workmen fail their master,<br/>
Faithlessly they ply the bellows.<br/>
Now the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Fans the flames with magic powers,<br/>
Blows one day, and then a second,<br/>
Blows a third from morn till even;<br/>
Then he looks within his furnace,<br/>
Looks around the oven-border,<br/>
Trusting there to see a maiden<br/>
Coming from the molten metals.<br/>
From the fire a virgin rises,<br/>
Golden-haired and silver-headed,<br/>
Beautiful in form and feature.<br/>
All are filled with awe and wonder,<br/>
But the artist and magician.<br/>
Ilmarinen, metal-worker,<br/>
Forges nights and days unceasing,<br/>
On the bride of his creation;<br/>
Feet he forges for the maiden,<br/>
Hands and arms, of gold and silver;<br/>
But her feet are not for walking,<br/>
Neither can her arms embrace him.<br/>
Ears he forges for the virgin,<br/>
But her ears are not for hearing;<br/>
Forges her a mouth of beauty,<br/>
Eyes he forges bright and sparkling;<br/>
But the magic mouth is speechless,<br/>
And the eyes are not for seeing.<br/>
Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<br/>
“This, indeed, a priceless maiden,<br/>
Could she only speak in wisdom,<br/>
Could she breathe the breath of Ukko!”<br/>
Thereupon he lays the virgin<br/>
On his silken couch of slumber,<br/>
On his downy place of resting.<br/>
Ilmarinen heats his bath-room,<br/>
Makes it ready for his service,<br/>
Binds together silken brushes,<br/>
Brings three cans of crystal water,<br/>
Wherewithal to lave the image,<br/>
Lave the golden maid of beauty.<br/>
When this task had been completed,<br/>
Ilmarinen, hoping, trusting,<br/>
Laid his golden bride to slumber,<br/>
On his downy couch of resting;<br/>
Ordered many silken wrappings,<br/>
Ordered bear-skins, three in number,<br/>
Ordered seven lambs-wool blankets,<br/>
Thus to keep him warm in slumber,<br/>
Sleeping by the golden image<br/>
Re had forged from magic metals.<br/>
Warm the side of Ilmarinen<br/>
That was wrapped in furs and blankets;<br/>
Chill the parts beside the maiden,<br/>
By his bride of gold and silver;<br/>
One side warm, the other lifeless,<br/>
Turning into ice from coldness.<br/>
Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Not for me was born this virgin<br/>
From the magic molten metals;<br/>
I shall take her to Wainola,<br/>
Give her to old Wainamoinen,<br/>
As a bride and life-companion,<br/>
Comfort to him in his dotage.”<br/>
Ilmarinen, much disheartened,<br/>
Takes the virgin to Wainola,<br/>
To the plains of Kalevala,<br/>
To his brother speaks as follows:<br/>
“O, thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br/>
Look with favor on this image;<br/>
Make the maiden fair and lovely,<br/>
Beautiful in form and feature,<br/>
Suited to thy years declining!”<br/>
Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br/>
Looked in wonder on the virgin,<br/>
On the golden bride of beauty,<br/>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Wherefore dost thou bring this maiden,<br/>
Wherefore bring to Wainamoinen<br/>
Bride of molten gold and silver?<br/>
Spake in answer Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Wherefore should I bring this image,<br/>
But for purposes the noblest?<br/>
I have brought her as companion<br/>
To thy life in years declining,<br/>
As a joy and consolation,<br/>
When thy days are full of trouble!”<br/>
Spake the good, old Wainamoinen:<br/>
“Magic brother, wonder-forger,<br/>
Throw the virgin to the furnace,<br/>
To the flames, thy golden image,<br/>
Forge from her a thousand trinkets.<br/>
Take the image into Ehstland,<br/>
Take her to the plains of Pohya,<br/>
That for her the mighty powers<br/>
May engage in deadly contest,<br/>
Worthy trophy for the victor;<br/>
Not for me this bride of wonder,<br/>
Neither for my worthy people.<br/>
I shall never wed an image<br/>
Born from many magic metals,<br/>
Never wed a silver maiden,<br/>
Never wed a golden virgin.”<br/>
Then the hero of the waters<br/>
Called together all his people,<br/>
Spake these words of ancient wisdom:<br/>
“Every child of Northland, listen,<br/>
Whether poor, or fortune-favored:<br/>
Never bow before an image<br/>
Born of molten gold and silver:<br/>
Never while the sunlight brightens,<br/>
Never while the moonlight glimmers,<br/>
Choose a maiden of the metals,<br/>
Choose a bride from gold created<br/>
Cold the lips of golden maiden,<br/>
Silver breathes the breath of sorrow.”</p>
