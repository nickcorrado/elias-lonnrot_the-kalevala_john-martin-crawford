<p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br/>
Heard the word in Sariola,<br/>
Heard the Dews with ears of envy,<br/>
That Wainola lives and prospers,<br/>
That Osmoinen’s wealth increases,<br/>
Through the ruins of the Sampo,<br/>
Ruins of the lid in colors.<br/>
Thereupon her wrath she kindled,<br/>
Well considered, long reflected,<br/>
How she might prepare destruction<br/>
For the people of Wainola,<br/>
For the tribes of Kalevala.<br/>
With this prayer she turns to Ukko,<br/>
Thus entreats the god of thunder:<br/>
“Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<br/>
Help me slay Wainola’s people<br/>
With thine iron-hail of justice,<br/>
With thine arrows tipped with lightning,<br/>
Or from sickness let them perish,<br/>
Let them die the death deserving;<br/>
Let the men die in the forest,<br/>
And the women in the hurdles!”<br/>
The blind daughter of Tuoni,<br/>
Old and wicked witch, Lowyatar,<br/>
Worst of all the Death-land women,<br/>
Ugliest of Mana’s children,<br/>
Source of all the host of evils,<br/>
All the ills and plagues of Northland,<br/>
Black in heart, and soul, and visage,<br/>
Evil genius of Lappala,<br/>
Made her couch along the wayside,<br/>
On the fields of sin and sorrow;<br/>
Turned her back upon the East-wind,<br/>
To the source of stormy weather,<br/>
To the chilling winds of morning.<br/>
When the winds arose at evening,<br/>
Heavy-laden grew Lowyatar,<br/>
Through the east-wind’s impregnation,<br/>
On the sand-plains, vast and barren.<br/>
Long she bore her weight of trouble,<br/>
Many morns she suffered anguish,<br/>
Till at last she leaves the desert,<br/>
Makes her couch within the forest,<br/>
On a rock upon the mountain;<br/>
Labors long to leave her burden<br/>
By the mountain-springs and fountains,<br/>
By the crystal waters flowing,<br/>
By the sacred stream and whirlpool,<br/>
By the cataract and fire-stream;<br/>
But her burden does not lighten.<br/>
Blind Lowyatar, old and ugly,<br/>
Knew not where to look for succor,<br/>
How to lose her weight of sorrow,<br/>
Where to lay her evil children.<br/>
Spake the Highest from the heavens,<br/>
These, the words of mighty Ukko:<br/>
“Is a triangle in Swamp-field,<br/>
Near the border of the ocean,<br/>
In the never-pleasant Northland,<br/>
In the dismal Sariola;<br/>
Thither go and lay thy burden,<br/>
In Pohyola leave thine offspring;<br/>
There the Laplanders await thee,<br/>
There will bid thy children welcome.”<br/>
Thereupon the blind Lowyatar,<br/>
Blackest daughter of Tuoni,<br/>
Mana’s old and ugly maiden,<br/>
Hastened on her journey northward,<br/>
To the chambers of Pohyola,<br/>
To the ancient halls of Louhi,<br/>
There to lay her heavy burdens,<br/>
There to leave her evil offspring.<br/>
Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br/>
Old and toothless witch of Pohya,<br/>
Takes Lowyatar to her mansion;<br/>
Silently she leads the stranger<br/>
To the bath-rooms of her chamber,<br/>
Pours the foaming beer of barley,<br/>
Lubricates the bolts and hinges,<br/>
That their movements may be secret,<br/>
Speaks these measures to Lowyatar:<br/>
“Faithful daughter of Creation,<br/>
Thou most beautiful of women,<br/>
First and last of ancient mothers,<br/>
Hasten on thy feet to ocean,<br/>
To the ocean’s centre hasten,<br/>
Take the sea-foam from the waters,<br/>
Take the honey of the mermaids,<br/>
And anoint thy sacred members,<br/>
That thy labors may be lightened.<br/>
“Should all this be unavailing,<br/>
Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<br/>
Hasten hither, thou art needed,<br/>
Come thou to thy child in trouble,<br/>
Help the helpless and afflicted.<br/>
Take thy golden-colored sceptre,<br/>
Charm away opposing forces,<br/>
Strike the pillars of the stronghold,<br/>
Open all resisting portals,<br/>
That the great and small may wander<br/>
From their ancient hiding-places,<br/>
Through the courts and halls of freedom.”<br/>
Finally the blind Lowyatar,<br/>
Wicked witch of Tuonela,<br/>
Was delivered of her burden,<br/>
Laid her offspring in the cradle,<br/>
Underneath the golden covers.<br/>
Thus at last were born nine children,<br/>
In an evening of the summer,<br/>
From Lowyatar, blind and ancient,<br/>
Ugly daughter of Tuoni.<br/>
Faithfully the virgin-mother<br/>
Guards her children in affection,<br/>
As an artist loves and nurses<br/>
What his skillful hands have fashioned.<br/>
Thus Lowyatar named her offspring,<br/>
Colic, Pleurisy, and Fever,<br/>
Ulcer, Plague, and dread Consumption,<br/>
Gout, Sterility, and Cancer.<br/>
And the worst of these nine children<br/>
Blind Lowyatar quickly banished,<br/>
Drove away as an enchanter,<br/>
To bewitch the lowland people,<br/>
To engender strife and envy.<br/>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Banished all the other children<br/>
To the fog-point in the ocean,<br/>
To the island forest-covered;<br/>
Banished all the fatal creatures,<br/>
Gave these wicked sons of evil<br/>
To the people of Wainola,<br/>
To the youth of Kalevala,<br/>
For the Kalew-tribe’s destruction.<br/>
Quick Wainola’s maidens sicken,<br/>
Young and aged, men and heroes,<br/>
With the worst of all diseases,<br/>
With diseases new and nameless;<br/>
Sick and dying is Wainola.<br/>
Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<br/>
Wise and wonderful enchanter,<br/>
Hastens to his people’s rescue,<br/>
Hastens to a war with Mana,<br/>
To a conflict with Tuoni,<br/>
To destroy the evil children<br/>
Of the evil maid, Lowyatar.<br/>
Wainamoinen heats the bath-rooms,<br/>
Heats the blocks of healing-sandstone<br/>
With the magic wood of Northland,<br/>
Gathered by the sacred river;<br/>
Water brings in covered buckets<br/>
From the cataract and whirlpool;<br/>
Brooms he brings enwrapped with ermine,<br/>
Well the bath the healer cleanses,<br/>
Softens well the brooms of birch-wood;<br/>
Then a honey-heat be wakens,<br/>
Fills the rooms with healing vapors,<br/>
From the virtue of the pebbles<br/>
Glowing in the heat of magic,<br/>
Thus he speaks in supplication:<br/>
“Come, O Ukko, to my rescue,<br/>
God of mercy, lend thy presence,<br/>
Give these vapor-baths new virtues,<br/>
Grant to them the powers of healing,<br/>
And restore my dying people;<br/>
Drive away these fell diseases,<br/>
Banish them to the unworthy,<br/>
Let the holy sparks enkindle,<br/>
Keep this heat in healing limits,<br/>
That it may not harm thy children,<br/>
May not injure the afflicted.<br/>
When I pour the sacred waters<br/>
On the heated blocks of sandstone,<br/>
May the water turn to honey<br/>
Laden with the balm of healing.<br/>
Let the stream of magic virtues<br/>
Ceaseless flow to all my children,<br/>
From this bath enrolled in sea-moss,<br/>
That the guiltless may not suffer,<br/>
That my tribe-folk may not perish,<br/>
Till the Master gives permission,<br/>
Until Ukko sends his minions,<br/>
Sends diseases of his choosing,<br/>
To destroy my trusting people.<br/>
Let the hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Wicked witch that sent these troubles,<br/>
Suffer from a gnawing conscience,<br/>
Suffer for her evil doings.<br/>
Should the Master of Wainola<br/>
Lose his magic skill and weaken,<br/>
Should he prove of little service<br/>
To deliver from misfortune,<br/>
To deliver from these evils,<br/>
Then may Ukko be our healer,<br/>
Be our strength and wise Physician.<br/>
“Omnipresent God of mercy,<br/>
Thou who livest in the heavens,<br/>
Hasten hither, thou art needed,<br/>
Hasten to thine ailing children,<br/>
To observe their cruel tortures,<br/>
To dispel these fell diseases,<br/>
Drive destruction from our borders.<br/>
Bring with thee thy mighty fire-sword,<br/>
Bring to me thy blade of lightning,<br/>
That I may subdue these evils,<br/>
That these monsters I may banish,<br/>
Send these pains, and ills, and tortures,<br/>
To the empire of Tuoni,<br/>
To the kingdom of the east-winds,<br/>
To the islands of the wicked,<br/>
To the caverns of the demons,<br/>
To the rocks within the mountains,<br/>
To the hidden beds of iron,<br/>
That the rocks may fall and sicken,<br/>
And the beds of iron perish.<br/>
Rocks and metals do not murmur<br/>
At the hands of the invader.<br/>
“Torture-daughter of Tuoni,<br/>
Sitting on the mount of anguish,<br/>
At the junction of three rivers,<br/>
Turning rocks of pain and torture,<br/>
Turn away these fell diseases<br/>
Through the virtues of the blue-stone;<br/>
Lead them to the water-channels,<br/>
Sink them in the deeps of ocean,<br/>
Where the winds can never find them,<br/>
Where the sunlight never enters.<br/>
“Should this prayer prove unavailing,<br/>
O, Health-virgin, maid of beauty<br/>
Come and heal my dying people,<br/>
Still their agonies and anguish,<br/>
Give them consciousness and comfort,<br/>
Give them healthful rest and slumber;<br/>
These diseases take and banish,<br/>
Take them in thy copper vessel,<br/>
To thy eaves within the mountains,<br/>
To the summit of the Pain-rock,<br/>
Hurl them to thy boiling caldrons.<br/>
In the mountain is a touch-stone,<br/>
Lucky-stone of ancient story,<br/>
With a hole bored through the centre,<br/>
Through this pour these pains and tortures,<br/>
Wretched feelings, thoughts of evil,<br/>
Human ailments, days unlucky,<br/>
Tribulations, and misfortunes,<br/>
That they may not rise at evening,<br/>
May not see the light of morning.”<br/>
Ending thus, old Wainamoinen,<br/>
The eternal, wise enchanter,<br/>
Rubbed his sufferers with balsams,<br/>
Rubbed the tissues, red and painful,<br/>
With the balm of healing flowers,<br/>
Balsams made of herbs enchanted,<br/>
Sprinkled all with healing vapors,<br/>
Spake these words in supplication.<br/>
“Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<br/>
God of justice, and of mercy,<br/>
Send us from the east a rain-cloud,<br/>
Send a dark cloud from the North-west,<br/>
From the north let fall a third one,<br/>
Send us mingled rain and honey,<br/>
Balsam from the great Physician,<br/>
To remove this plague of Northland.<br/>
What I know of healing measures,<br/>
Only comes from my Creator;<br/>
Lend me, therefore, of thy wisdom,<br/>
That I may relieve my people,<br/>
Save them from the fell destroyer,<br/>
If my hands should fall in virtue,<br/>
Let the hands of Ukko follow,<br/>
God alone can save from trouble.<br/>
Come to us with thine enchantment,<br/>
Speak the magic words of healing,<br/>
That my people may not perish;<br/>
Give to all alleviation<br/>
From their sicknesses and sorrows;<br/>
In the morning, in the evening,<br/>
Let their wasting ailments vanish;<br/>
Drive the Death-child from Wainola,<br/>
Nevermore to visit Northland,<br/>
Never in the course of ages,<br/>
Never while the moonlight glimmers<br/>
O’er the lakes of Kalevala.”<br/>
Wainamoinen, the enchanter,<br/>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<br/>
Thus expelled the nine diseases,<br/>
Evil children or Lowyatar,<br/>
Healed the tribes of Kalevala,<br/>
Saved his people from destruction.</p>
