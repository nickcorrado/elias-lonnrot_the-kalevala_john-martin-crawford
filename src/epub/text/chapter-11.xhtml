<p>This the time to sing of Ahti,<br/>
Son of Lempo, Kaukomieli,<br/>
Also known as Lemminkainen.<br/>
Ahti was the king of islands,<br/>
Grew amid the island-dwellings,<br/>
At the site of his dear mother,<br/>
On the borders of the ocean,<br/>
On the points of promontories.<br/>
Ahti fed upon the salmon,<br/>
Fed upon the ocean whiting,<br/>
Thus became a mighty hero,<br/>
In his veins the blood of ages,<br/>
Read erect and form commanding,<br/>
Growth of mind and body perfect<br/>
But alas! he had his failings,<br/>
Bad indeed his heart and morals,<br/>
Roaming in unworthy places,<br/>
Staying days and nights in sequences<br/>
At the homes of merry maidens,<br/>
At the dances of the virgins,<br/>
With the maids of braided tresses.<br/>
Up in Sahri lived a maiden,<br/>
Lived the fair and winsome Kulli,<br/>
Lovely as a summer-flower,<br/>
From a kingly house descended,<br/>
Grew to perfect form and beauty,<br/>
Living in her father’s cottage,<br/>
Home of many ancient heroes,<br/>
Beautiful was she and queenly,<br/>
Praised throughout the whole of Ehstland;<br/>
From afar men came to woo her,<br/>
To the birthplace of the virgin,<br/>
To the household of her mother.<br/>
For his son the Day-star wooes her,<br/>
But she will not go to Sun-land,<br/>
Will not shine beside the Day-star,<br/>
In his haste to bring the summer.<br/>
For her son, the bright Moon wooes her,<br/>
But she will not go to Moon-land,<br/>
By the bright Moon will not glimmer,<br/>
Will not run through boundless ether.<br/>
For his son the Night-star wooes her,<br/>
But she will not go to Star-land,<br/>
Will not twinkle in the starlight,<br/>
Through the dreary nights in winter.<br/>
Lovers come from distant Ehstlaud,<br/>
Others come from far-off Ingern,<br/>
But they cannot win the maiden,<br/>
This the answer that she gives them<br/>
“Vainly are your praises lavished<br/>
Vainly is your silver offered,<br/>
Wealth and praise are no temptation;<br/>
Never shall I go to Ehstland,<br/>
Never shall I go a-rowing<br/>
On the waters of the Ingern,<br/>
Shall not cross the Sahri-waters,<br/>
Never eat the fish of Ehstland,<br/>
Never taste the Ehstland viands.<br/>
Ingerland shall never see me,<br/>
Will not row upon her rivers,<br/>
Will not step within her borders;<br/>
Hunger there, and fell starvation,<br/>
Wood is absent, fuel wanting,<br/>
Neither water, wheat, nor barley,<br/>
Even rye is not abundant.”<br/>
Lemminkainen of the islands,<br/>
Warlike hero, Kaukomieli,<br/>
Undertakes to win the maiden,<br/>
Woo and win the Sahri-flower,<br/>
Win a bride so highly honored,<br/>
Win the maid with golden tresses,<br/>
Win the Sahri maid of beauty;<br/>
But his mother gives him warning:<br/>
“Nay,” replies his gray-haired mother,<br/>
“Do not woo, my son beloved,<br/>
Maiden of a higher station;<br/>
She will never make thee happy<br/>
With her lineage of Sahri.”<br/>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<br/>
These the words of Kaukomieli:<br/>
“Should I come from lowly station,<br/>
Though my tribe is not the highest,<br/>
I shall woo to please my fancy,<br/>
Woo the maiden fair and lovely,<br/>
Choose a wife for worth and beauty.”<br/>
This the anxious mother’s answer:<br/>
“Lemminkainen, son beloved,<br/>
Listen to advice maternal:<br/>
Do not go to distant Sahri,<br/>
To her tribe of many branches;<br/>
All the maidens there will taunt thee,<br/>
All the women will deride thee.”<br/>
Lemminkainen, little hearing,<br/>
Answers thus his mother’s pleading:<br/>
“I will still the sneers of women,<br/>
Silence all the taunts of maidens,<br/>
I will crush their haughty bosoms,<br/>
Smite the hands and cheeks of infants;<br/>
Surely this will check their insults,<br/>
Fitting ending to derision!”<br/>
This the answer of the mother:<br/>
“Woe is me, my son beloved!<br/>
Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br/>
Shouldst thou taunt the Sahri daughters.<br/>
Or insult the maids of virtue,<br/>
Shouldst thou laugh them to derision,<br/>
There will rise a great contention,<br/>
Fierce the battle that will follow.<br/>
All the hosts of Sahri-suitors,<br/>
Armed in thousands will attack thee,<br/>
And will slay thee for thy folly.”<br/>
Nothing listing, Lemminkainen,<br/>
Heeding not his mother’s warning,<br/>
Led his war-horse from the stables,<br/>
Quickly hitched the fiery charger,<br/>
Fleetly drove upon his journey,<br/>
To the distant Sahri-village,<br/>
There to woo the Sahri-flower,<br/>
There to win the Bride of Beauty.<br/>
All the aged Sahri-women,<br/>
All the young and lovely maidens<br/>
Laughed to scorn the coming stranger<br/>
Driving careless through the alleys,<br/>
Wildly driving through the court-yard,<br/>
Now upsetting in the gate-way,<br/>
Breaking shaft, and hame, and runner.<br/>
Then the fearless Lemminkainen,<br/>
Mouth awry and visage wrinkled,<br/>
Shook his sable locks and answered:<br/>
“Never in my recollection<br/>
Have I heard or seen such treatment,<br/>
Never have I been derided,<br/>
Never suffered sneers of women,<br/>
Never suffered scorn of virgins,<br/>
Not in my immortal life-time.<br/>
Is there any place befitting<br/>
On the Sahri-plains and pastures,<br/>
Where to join in songs and dances?<br/>
Is there here a hall for pleasure,<br/>
Where the Sahri-maidens linger,<br/>
Merry maids with braided tresses?”<br/>
Thereupon the Sahri-maidens<br/>
Answered from their promontory.,<br/>
“Room enough is there in Sahri,<br/>
Room upon the Sahri-pastures,<br/>
Room for pleasure-halls and dances;<br/>
Sing and dance upon our meadows,<br/>
Be a shepherd on the mountains,<br/>
Shepherd-boys have room for dancing;<br/>
Indolent the Sahri-children,<br/>
But the colts are fat and frisky.”<br/>
Little caring, Lemminkainen<br/>
Entered service there as shepherd,<br/>
In the daytime on the pastures,<br/>
In the evening, making merry<br/>
At the games of lively maidens,<br/>
At the dances with the virgins,<br/>
With the maids with braided tresses.<br/>
Thus it was that Lemminkainen,<br/>
Thus the shepherd, Kaukomieli,<br/>
Quickly hushed the women’s laughter,<br/>
Quickly quenched the taunts of maidens,<br/>
Quickly silenced their derision.<br/>
All the dames and Sahri-daughters<br/>
Soon were feasting Lemminkainen,<br/>
At his side they danced and lingered.<br/>
Only was there one among them,<br/>
One among the Sahri-virgins,<br/>
Harbored neither love nor wooers,<br/>
Favored neither gods nor heroes,<br/>
This the lovely maid Kyllikki,<br/>
This the Sahri’s fairest flower.<br/>
Lemminkainen, full of pleasure,<br/>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br/>
Rowed a hundred boats in pieces,<br/>
Pulled a thousand oars to fragments,<br/>
While he wooed the Maid of Beauty,<br/>
Tried to win the fair Kyllikki.<br/>
Finally the lovely maiden,<br/>
Fairest daughter of the Northland,<br/>
Thus addresses Lemminkainen:<br/>
“Why dost linger here, thou weak one,<br/>
Why dost murmur on these borders,<br/>
Why come wooing at my fireside,<br/>
Wooing me in belt of copper?<br/>
Have no time to waste upon thee,<br/>
Rather give this stone its polish,<br/>
Rather would I turn the pestle<br/>
In the heavy sandstone mortar;<br/>
Rather sit beside my mother<br/>
In the dwellings of my father.<br/>
Never shall I heed thy wooing,<br/>
Neither wights nor whisks I care for,<br/>
Sooner have a slender husband<br/>
Since I have a slender body;<br/>
Wish to have him fine of figure,<br/>
Since perchance I am well-shapen;<br/>
Wish to have him tall and stately,<br/>
Since my form perchance is queenly;<br/>
Never waste thy time in wooing<br/>
Saliri’s maid and favored flower.”<br/>
Time had gone but little distance,<br/>
Scarcely had a month passed over,<br/>
When upon a merry evening,<br/>
Where the maidens meet for dancing,<br/>
In the glen beyond the meadow,<br/>
On a level patch of verdure,<br/>
Came too soon the maid Kyllikki,<br/>
Sahri’s pride, the Maid of Beauty;<br/>
Quickly followed Lemminkainen,<br/>
With his stallion proudly prancing,<br/>
Fleetest racer of the Northland,<br/>
Fleetly drives beyond the meadow,<br/>
Where the maidens meet for dancing,<br/>
Snatches quick the maid Kyllikki,<br/>
On the settle seats the maiden,<br/>
Quickly draws the leathern cover,<br/>
And adjusts the brichen cross-bar,<br/>
Whips his courser to a gallop.<br/>
With a rush, and roar, and rattle,<br/>
Speeds he homeward like the storm-wind,<br/>
Speaks these words to those that listen:<br/>
“Never, never, anxious maidens,<br/>
Must ye give the information,<br/>
That I carried off Kyllikki<br/>
To my distant home and kindred.<br/>
If ye do not heed this order,<br/>
Ye shall badly fare as maidens;<br/>
I shall sing to war your suitors,<br/>
Sing them under spear and broadsword,<br/>
That for months, and years, and ages,<br/>
Never ye will see their faces,<br/>
Never hear their merry voices,<br/>
Never will they tread these uplands,<br/>
Never will they join these dances,<br/>
Never will they drive these highways.”<br/>
Sad the wailing of Kyllikki,<br/>
Sad the weeping flower of Sahri!<br/>
Listen to her tearful pleading:<br/>
“Give, O give me back my freedom,<br/>
Free me from the throes of thralldom,<br/>
Let this maiden wander homeward,<br/>
By some foot-path let me wander<br/>
To my father who is grieving,<br/>
To my mother who is weeping;<br/>
Let me go or I will curse thee!<br/>
If thou wilt not give me freedom,<br/>
Wilt not let me wander homeward,<br/>
Where my loved ones wait my coming,<br/>
I have seven stalwart brothers,<br/>
Seven sons of father’s brother,<br/>
Seven sons of mother’s sister,<br/>
Who pursue the tracks of red-deer,<br/>
Hunt the hare upon the heather;<br/>
They will follow thee and slay thee,<br/>
Thus I’ll gain my wished-for freedom.”<br/>
Lemminkainen, little heeding,<br/>
Would not grant the maiden’s wishes,<br/>
Would not heed her plea for mercy.<br/>
Spake again the waiting virgin,<br/>
Pride and beauty of the Northland:<br/>
“Joyful was I with my kindred,<br/>
Joyful born and softly nurtured<br/>
Merrily I spent my childhood,<br/>
Happy I, in virgin-freedom,<br/>
In the dwelling of my father,<br/>
By the bedside of my mother,<br/>
With my lineage in Sahri;<br/>
But alas! all joy has vanished,<br/>
All my happiness departed,<br/>
All my maiden beauty waneth<br/>
Since I met thine evil spirit,<br/>
Shameless hero of dishonor,<br/>
Cruel fighter of the islands,<br/>
Merciless in civil combat.”<br/>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<br/>
These the words of Kaukomieli:<br/>
“Dearest maiden, fair Kyllikki,<br/>
My sweet strawberry of Pohya,<br/>
Still thine anguish, cease thy weeping,<br/>
Be thou free from care and sorrow,<br/>
Never shall I do thee evil,<br/>
Never will my hands maltreat thee,<br/>
Never will mine arms abuse thee,<br/>
Never will my tongue revile thee,<br/>
Never will my heart deceive thee.<br/>
“Tell me why thou hast this anguish,<br/>
Why thou hast this bitter sorrow,<br/>
Why this sighing and lamenting,<br/>
Tell me why this wail of sadness?<br/>
Banish all thy cares and sorrows,<br/>
Dry thy tears and still thine anguish,<br/>
I have cattle, food, and shelter,<br/>
I have home, and friends, and kindred,<br/>
Kine upon the plains and uplands,<br/>
In the marshes berries plenty,<br/>
Strawberries upon the mountains<br/>
I have kine that need no milking,<br/>
Handsome kine that need no feeding,<br/>
Beautiful if not well-tended;<br/>
Need not tie them up at evening,<br/>
Need not free them in the morning,<br/>
Need not hunt them, need not feed them,<br/>
Need not give them salt nor water.<br/>
“Thinkest thou my race is lowly,<br/>
Dost thou think me born ignoble,<br/>
Does my lineage agrieve thee?<br/>
Was not born in lofty station,<br/>
From a tribe of noble heroes,<br/>
From a worthy race descended;<br/>
But I have a sword of fervor,<br/>
And a spear yet filled with courage,<br/>
Surely these are well descended,<br/>
These were born from hero-races,<br/>
Sharpened by the mighty Hisi,<br/>
By the gods were forged and burnished;<br/>
Therefore will I give thee greatness,<br/>
Greatness of my race and nation,<br/>
With my broadsword filled with fervor,<br/>
With my spear still filled with courage.”<br/>
Anxiously the sighing maiden<br/>
Thus addresses Lemminkainen:<br/>
“O thou Ahti, son of Lempo,<br/>
Wilt thou take this trusting virgin,<br/>
As thy faithful life-companion,<br/>
Take me under thy protection,<br/>
Be to me a faithful husband,<br/>
Swear to me an oath of honor,<br/>
That thou wilt not go to battle,<br/>
When for gold thou hast a longing,<br/>
When thou wishest gold and silver?”<br/>
This is Lemminkainen’s answer:<br/>
I will swear an oath of honor,<br/>
That I’ll never go to battle,<br/>
When for gold I feel a longing,<br/>
When I wish for gold and silver.<br/>
Swear thou also on thine honor,<br/>
Thou wilt go not to the village,<br/>
When desire for dance impels thee,<br/>
Wilt not visit village-dances.”<br/>
Thus the two made oath together,<br/>
Registered their vows in heaven,<br/>
Vowed before omniscient Ukko,<br/>
Ne’er to go to war vowed Ahti,<br/>
Never to the dance, Kyllikki.<br/>
Lemminkainen, full of joyance,<br/>
Snapped his whip above his courser,<br/>
Whipped his racer to a gallop,<br/>
And these words the hero uttered:<br/>
“Fare ye well, ye Sahri-meadows,<br/>
Roots of firs, and stumps of birch-trees.<br/>
That I wandered through in summer,<br/>
That I travelled o’er in winter,<br/>
Where ofttimes in rainy seasons,<br/>
At the evening hour I lingered,<br/>
When I sought to win the virgin,<br/>
Sought to win the Maid of Beauty,<br/>
Fairest of the Sahri-flowers.<br/>
Fare ye well, ye Sahri-woodlands,<br/>
Seas and oceans, lakes and rivers,<br/>
Vales and mountains, isles and inlets,<br/>
Once the home of fair Kyllikki!”<br/>
Quick the racer galloped homeward,<br/>
Galloped on along the highway,<br/>
Toward the meadows of Wainola,<br/>
To the plains of Kalevala.<br/>
As they neared the Ahti-dwellings,<br/>
Thus Kyllikki spake in sorrow:<br/>
“Cold and drear is thy cottage,<br/>
Seeming like a place deserted;<br/>
Who may own this dismal cabin,<br/>
Who the one so little honored?”<br/>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<br/>
These the words that Ahti uttered:<br/>
“Do not grieve about my cottage,<br/>
Have no care about my chambers;<br/>
I shall build thee other dwellings,<br/>
I shall fashion them much better,<br/>
Beams, and posts, and sills, and rafters,<br/>
Fashioned from the sacred birch-wood.”<br/>
Now they reach the home of Ahti,<br/>
Lemminkainen’s home and birthplace,<br/>
Enter they his mother’s cottage;<br/>
There they meet his aged mother,<br/>
These the words the mother uses:<br/>
“Long indeed hast thou been absent,<br/>
Long in foreign lands hast wandered,<br/>
Long in Sahri thou hast lingered!”<br/>
This is Lemminkainen’s answer:<br/>
“All the host of Sahri-women,<br/>
All the chaste and lovely maidens,<br/>
All the maids with braided tresses,<br/>
Well have paid for their derision,<br/>
For their scorn and for their laughter,<br/>
That they basely heaped upon me.<br/>
I have brought the best among them<br/>
In my sledge to this thy cottage;<br/>
Well I wrapped her in my fur-robes,<br/>
Kept her warm enwrapped in bear-skin,<br/>
Brought her to my mother’s dwelling,<br/>
As my faithful life-companion;<br/>
Thus I paid the scornful maidens,<br/>
Paid them well for their derision.<br/>
“Cherished mother of my being,<br/>
I have found the long-sought jewel,<br/>
I have won the Maid of Beauty.<br/>
Spread our couch with finest linen,<br/>
For our heads the softest pillows,<br/>
On our table rarest viands,<br/>
So that I may dwell in pleasure<br/>
With my spouse, the bride of honor,<br/>
With the pride of distant Sahri.”<br/>
This the answer of the mother:<br/>
“Be thou praised, O gracious Ukko,<br/>
Loudly praised, O thou Creator,<br/>
Since thou givest me a daughter,<br/>
Ahti’s bride, my second daughter,<br/>
Who can stir the fire at evening,<br/>
Who can weave me finest fabrics,<br/>
Who can twirl the useful spindle,<br/>
Who can rinse my silken ribbons,<br/>
Who can full the richest garments.<br/>
“Son beloved, praise thy Maker,<br/>
For the winning of this virgin,<br/>
Pride and joy of distant Sahri<br/>
Kind indeed is thy Creator,<br/>
Wise the ever-knowing Ukko!<br/>
Pure the snow upon the mountains,<br/>
Purer still thy Bride of Beauty;<br/>
White the foam upon the ocean,<br/>
Whiter still her virgin-spirit;<br/>
Graceful on the lakes, the white-swan,<br/>
Still more graceful, thy companion:<br/>
Beautiful the stars in heaven,<br/>
Still more beautiful, Kyllikki.<br/>
Larger make our humble cottage,<br/>
Wider build the doors and windows,<br/>
Fashion thou the ceilings higher,<br/>
Decorate the walls in beauty,<br/>
Now that thou a bride hast taken<br/>
From a tribe of higher station,<br/>
Purest maiden of creation,<br/>
From the meadow-lands of Sahri,<br/>
From the upper shores of Northland.”</p>
