<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br/>
Now arranges for a journey<br/>
To the village of the Northland,<br/>
To the land of cruel winters,<br/>
To the land of little sunshine,<br/>
To the land of worthy women;<br/>
Takes his light-foot, royal racer,<br/>
Then adjusts the golden bridle,<br/>
Lays upon his back the saddle,<br/>
Silver-buckled, copper-stirruped,<br/>
Seats himself upon his courser,<br/>
And begins his journey northward;<br/>
Plunges onward, onward, onward,<br/>
Galloping along the highway,<br/>
In his saddle, gaily fashioned,<br/>
On his dappled steed of magic,<br/>
Plunging through Wainola’s meadows,<br/>
O’er the plains of Kalevala.<br/>
Fast and far he galloped onward,<br/>
Galloped far beyond Wainola,<br/>
Bounded o’er the waste of waters,<br/>
Till he reached the blue-sea’s margin,<br/>
Wetting not the hoofs in running.<br/>
But the evil Youkahainen<br/>
Nursed a grudge within his bosom,<br/>
In his heart the worm of envy,<br/>
Envy of this Wainamoinen,<br/>
Of this wonderful enchanter.<br/>
He prepares a cruel cross-bow,<br/>
Made of steel and other metals,<br/>
Paints the bow in many colors,<br/>
Molds the top-piece out or copper,<br/>
Trims his bow with snowy silver,<br/>
Gold he uses too in trimming,<br/>
Then he hunts for strongest sinews,<br/>
Finds them in the stag of Hisi,<br/>
Interweaves the flax of Lempo.<br/>
Ready is the cruel cross-bow,<br/>
String, and shaft, and ends are finished,<br/>
Beautiful the bow and mighty,<br/>
Surely cost it not a trifle;<br/>
On the back a painted courser,<br/>
On each end a colt of beauty,<br/>
Near the curve a maiden sleeping<br/>
Near the notch a hare is bounding,<br/>
Wonderful the bow thus fashioned;<br/>
Cuts some arrows for his quiver,<br/>
Covers them with finest feathers,<br/>
From the oak the shafts be fashions,<br/>
Makes the tips of keenest metal.<br/>
As the rods and points are finished,<br/>
Then he feathers well his arrows<br/>
From the plumage of the swallow,<br/>
From the wing-quills of the sparrow;<br/>
Hardens well his feathered arrows,<br/>
And imparts to each new virtues,<br/>
Steeps them in the blood of serpents,<br/>
In the virus of the adder.<br/>
Ready now are all his arrows,<br/>
Ready strung, his cruel cross-bow.<br/>
Waiting for wise Wainamoinen.<br/>
Youkahainen, Lapland’s minstrel,<br/>
Waits a long time, is not weary,<br/>
Hopes to spy the ancient singer;<br/>
Spies at day-dawn, spies at evening,<br/>
Spies he ceaselessly at noontide,<br/>
Lies in wait for the magician,<br/>
Waits, and watches, as in envy;<br/>
Sits he at the open window,<br/>
Stands behind the hedge, and watches<br/>
In the foot-path waits, and listens,<br/>
Spies along the balks of meadows;<br/>
On his back he hangs his quiver,<br/>
In his quiver, feathered arrows<br/>
Dipped in virus of the viper,<br/>
On his arm the mighty cross-bow,<br/>
Waits, and watches, and unwearied,<br/>
Listens from the boat-house window,<br/>
Lingers at the end of Fog-point,<br/>
By the river flowing seaward,<br/>
Near the holy stream and whirlpool,<br/>
Near the sacred river’s fire-fall.<br/>
Finally the Lapland minstrel,<br/>
Youkahainen of Pohyola,<br/>
At the breaking of the day-dawn,<br/>
At the early hour of morning,<br/>
Fixed his gaze upon the North-east,<br/>
Turned his eyes upon the sunrise,<br/>
Saw a black cloud on the ocean,<br/>
Something blue upon the waters,<br/>
And soliloquized as follows:<br/>
“Are those clouds on the horizon,<br/>
Or perchance the dawn of morning?<br/>
Neither clouds on the horizon,<br/>
Nor the dawning of the morning;<br/>
It is ancient Wainamoinen,<br/>
The renowned and wise enchanter,<br/>
Riding on his way to Northland;<br/>
On his steed, the royal racer,<br/>
Magic courser of Wainola.”<br/>
Quickly now young Youkahainen,<br/>
Lapland’s vain and evil minstrel,<br/>
Filled with envy, grasps his cross-bow,<br/>
Makes his bow and arrows ready<br/>
For the death of Wainamoinen.<br/>
Quick his aged mother asked him,<br/>
Spake these words to Youkahainen:<br/>
“For whose slaughter is thy cross-bow,<br/>
For whose heart thy poisoned arrows?”<br/>
Youkahainen thus made answer:<br/>
“I have made this mighty cross-bow,<br/>
Fashioned bow and poisoned arrows<br/>
For the death of Wainamoinen,<br/>
Thus to slay the friend of waters;<br/>
I must shoot the old magician,<br/>
The eternal bard and hero,<br/>
Through the heart, and through the liver,<br/>
Through the head, and through the shoulders,<br/>
With this bow and feathered arrows<br/>
Thus destroy my rival minstrel.”<br/>
Then the aged mother answered,<br/>
Thus reproving, thus forbidding.<br/>
Do not slay good Wainamoinen,<br/>
Ancient hero of the Northland,<br/>
From a noble tribe descended,<br/>
He, my sister’s son, my nephew.<br/>
If thou slayest Wainamoinen,<br/>
Ancient son of Kalevala,<br/>
Then alas! all joy will vanish,<br/>
Perish all our wondrous singing;<br/>
Better on the earth the gladness,<br/>
Better here the magic music,<br/>
Than within the nether regions,<br/>
In the kingdom of Tuoni,<br/>
In the realm of the departed,<br/>
In the land of the hereafter.”<br/>
Then the youthful Youkahainen<br/>
Thought awhile and well considered,<br/>
Ere he made a final answer.<br/>
With one hand he raised the cross-bow<br/>
But the other seemed to weaken,<br/>
As he drew the cruel bow-string.<br/>
Finally these words he uttered<br/>
As his bosom swelled with envy:<br/>
“Let all joy forever vanish,<br/>
Let earth’s pleasures quickly perish,<br/>
Disappear earth’s sweetest music,<br/>
Happiness depart forever;<br/>
Shoot I will this rival minstrel,<br/>
Little heeding what the end is.”<br/>
Quickly now he bends his fire-bow,<br/>
On his left knee rests the weapon,<br/>
With his right foot firmly planted,<br/>
Thus he strings his bow of envy;<br/>
Takes three arrows from his quiver,<br/>
Choosing well the best among them,<br/>
Carefully adjusts the bow-string,<br/>
Sets with care the feathered arrow,<br/>
To the flaxen string he lays it,<br/>
Holds the cross-bow to his shoulder,<br/>
Aiming well along the margin,<br/>
At the heart of Wainamoinen,<br/>
Waiting till he gallops nearer;<br/>
In the shadow of a thicket,<br/>
Speaks these words while he is waiting<br/>
“Be thou, flaxen string, elastic;<br/>
Swiftly fly, thou feathered ash-wood,<br/>
Swiftly speed, thou deadly missile,<br/>
Quick as light, thou poisoned arrow,<br/>
To the heart of Wainamoinen.<br/>
If my hand too low should hold thee,<br/>
May the gods direct thee higher;<br/>
If too high mine eye should aim thee,<br/>
May the gods direct thee lower.”<br/>
Steady now he pulls the trigger;<br/>
Like the lightning flies the arrow<br/>
O’er the head of Wainamoinen;<br/>
To the upper sky it darteth,<br/>
And the highest clouds it pierces,<br/>
Scatters all the flock of lamb-clouds,<br/>
On its rapid journey skyward.<br/>
Not discouraged, quick selecting,<br/>
Quick adjusting, Youkahainen,<br/>
Quickly aiming shoots a second.<br/>
Speeds the arrow swift as lightning;<br/>
Much too low he aimed the missile,<br/>
Into earth the arrow plunges,<br/>
Pierces to the lower regions,<br/>
Splits in two the old Sand Mountain.<br/>
Nothing daunted, Youkahainen,<br/>
Quick adjusting shoots a third one.<br/>
Swift as light it speeds its journey,<br/>
Strikes the steed of Wainamoinen,<br/>
Strikes the light-foot, ocean-swimmer,<br/>
Strikes him near his golden girdle,<br/>
Through the shoulder of the racer.<br/>
Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<br/>
Headlong fell upon the waters,<br/>
Plunged beneath the rolling billows,<br/>
From the saddle of the courser,<br/>
From his dappled steed of magic.<br/>
Then arose a mighty storm-wind,<br/>
Roaring wildly on the waters,<br/>
Bore away old Wainamoinen<br/>
Far from land upon the billows,<br/>
On the high and rolling billows,<br/>
On the broad sea’s great expanses.<br/>
Boasted then young Youkahainen,<br/>
Thinking Waino dead and buried,<br/>
These the boastful words be uttered:<br/>
“Nevermore, old Wainamoinen,<br/>
Nevermore in all thy life-time,<br/>
While the golden moonlight glistens,<br/>
Nevermore wilt fix thy vision<br/>
On the meadows of Wainola,<br/>
On the plains of Kalevala;<br/>
Full six years must swim the ocean,<br/>
Tread the waves for seven summers,<br/>
Eight years ride the foamy billows,<br/>
In the broad expanse of water;<br/>
Six long autumns as a fir-tree,<br/>
Seven winters as a pebble;<br/>
Eight long summers as an aspen.”<br/>
Thereupon the Lapland minstrel<br/>
Hastened to his room delighting,<br/>
When his mother thus addressed him<br/>
“Hast thou slain good Wainamoinen,<br/>
Slain the son of Kalevala?”<br/>
Youkahainen thus made answer:<br/>
“I have slain old Wainamoinen,<br/>
Slain the son of Kalevala,<br/>
That he now may plow the ocean,<br/>
That he now may sweep the waters,<br/>
On the billows rock and slumber.<br/>
In the salt-sea plunged he headlong,<br/>
In the deep sank the magician,<br/>
Sidewise turned he to the sea-shore<br/>
On his back to rock forever,<br/>
Thus the boundless sea to travel,<br/>
Thus to ride the rolling billows.”<br/>
This the answer of the mother:<br/>
“Woe to earth for this thine action,<br/>
Gone forever, joy and singing,<br/>
Vanished is the wit of ages!<br/>
Thou hast slain good Wainamoinen.<br/>
Slain the ancient wisdom-singer,<br/>
Slain the pride of Suwantala,<br/>
Slain the hero of Wainola,<br/>
Slain the joy of Kalevala.”</p>
