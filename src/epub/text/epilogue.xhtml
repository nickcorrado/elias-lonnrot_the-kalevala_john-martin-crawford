			<h2 epub:type="title">Epilogue</h2>
<p>Now I end my measured singing,<br/>
Bid my weary tongue keep silence,<br/>
Leave my songs to other singers.<br/>
Horses have their times of resting<br/>
After many hours of labor;<br/>
Even sickles will grow weary<br/>
When they have been long at reaping;<br/>
Waters seek a quiet haven<br/>
After running long in rivers;<br/>
Fire subsides and sinks in slumber<br/>
At the dawning of the morning<br/>
Therefore I should end my singing,<br/>
As my song is growing weary,<br/>
For the pleasure of the evening,<br/>
For the joy of morn arising.<br/>
Often I have heard it chanted,<br/>
Often heard the words repeated:<br/>
“Worthy cataracts and rivers<br/>
Never empty all their waters.”<br/>
Thus the wise and worthy singer<br/>
Sings not all his garnered wisdom;<br/>
Better leave unsung some sayings<br/>
Than to sing them out of season.<br/>
Thus beginning, and thus ending,<br/>
Do I roll up all my legends,<br/>
Roll them in a ball for safety,<br/>
In my memory arrange them,<br/>
In their narrow place of resting,<br/>
Lest the songs escape unheeded,<br/>
While the lock is still unopened,<br/>
While the teeth remain unparted,<br/>
And the weary tongue is silent.<br/>
Why should I sing other legends,<br/>
Chant them in the glen and forest,<br/>
Sing them on the hill and heather?<br/>
Cold and still my golden mother<br/>
Lies beneath the meadow, sleeping,<br/>
Hears my ancient songs no longer,<br/>
Cannot listen to my singing;<br/>
Only will the forest listen,<br/>
Sacred birches, sighing pine-trees,<br/>
Junipers endowed with kindness,<br/>
Alder-trees that love to bear me,<br/>
With the aspens and the willows.<br/>
When my loving mother left me,<br/>
Young was I, and low of stature;<br/>
Like the cuckoo of the forest,<br/>
Like the thrush upon the heather,<br/>
Like the lark I learned to twitter,<br/>
Learned to sing my simple measures,<br/>
Guided by a second mother,<br/>
Stern and cold, without affection;<br/>
Drove me helpless from my chamber<br/>
To the wind-side of her dwelling,<br/>
To the north-side of her cottage,<br/>
Where the chilling winds in mercy<br/>
Carried off the unprotected.<br/>
As a lark I learned to wander,<br/>
Wander as a lonely song-bird,<br/>
Through the forests and the fenlands<br/>
Quietly o’er hill and heather;<br/>
Walked in pain about the marshes,<br/>
Learned the songs of winds and waters,<br/>
Learned the music of the ocean,<br/>
And the echoes of the woodlands.<br/>
Many men that live to murmur,<br/>
Many women live to censure,<br/>
Many speak with evil motives;<br/>
Many they with wretched voices<br/>
Curse me for my wretched singing,<br/>
Blame my tongue for speaking wisdom,<br/>
Call my ancient songs unworthy,<br/>
Blame the songs and curse the singer.<br/>
Be not thus, my worthy people,<br/>
Blame me not for singing badly,<br/>
Unpretending as a minstrel.<br/>
I have never had the teaching,<br/>
Never lived with ancient heroes,<br/>
Never learned the tongues of strangers,<br/>
Never claimed to know much wisdom.<br/>
Others have had language-masters,<br/>
Nature was my only teacher,<br/>
Woods and waters my instructors.<br/>
Homeless, friendless, lone, and needy,<br/>
Save in childhood with my mother,<br/>
When beneath her painted rafters,<br/>
Where she twirled the flying spindle,<br/>
By the work-bench of my brother,<br/>
By the window of my sister,<br/>
In. the cabin of my father,<br/>
In my early days of childhood.<br/>
Be this as it may, my people,<br/>
This may point the way to others,<br/>
To the singers better gifted,<br/>
For the good of future ages,<br/>
For the coming generations,<br/>
For the rising folk of Suomi.</p>
