<p>Wainamoinen, the enchanter,<br/>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<br/>
Long reflected, well considered,<br/>
How to weave the net of flax-yarn,<br/>
Weave the fish-net of the fathers.<br/>
Spake the minstrel of Wainola:<br/>
“Who will plow the field and fallow,<br/>
Sow the flax, and spin the flax-threads,<br/>
That I may prepare the fish-net,<br/>
Wherewith I may catch the Fire-pike,<br/>
May secure the thing of evil?”<br/>
Soon they found a fertile island,<br/>
Found the fallow soil befitting,<br/>
On the border of the heather,<br/>
And between two stately oak-trees.<br/>
They prepared the soil for sowing.<br/>
Searching everywhere for flax-seed,<br/>
Found it in Tuoni’s kingdom,<br/>
In the keeping of an insect.<br/>
Then they found a pile of ashes,<br/>
Where the fire had burned a vessel;<br/>
In the ashes sowed the seedlings<br/>
Near the Alue-lake and border,<br/>
In the rich and loamy fallow.<br/>
There the seed took root and flourished,<br/>
Quickly grew to great proportions,<br/>
In a single night in summer.<br/>
Thus the flax was sowed at evening,<br/>
Placed within the earth by moonlight;<br/>
Quick it grew, and quickly ripened,<br/>
Quick Wainola’s heroes pulled it,<br/>
Quick they broke it on the hackles,<br/>
Hastened with it to the waters,<br/>
Dipped it in the lake and washed it;<br/>
Quickly brought it borne and dried it.<br/>
Quickly broke, and combed, and smoothed it,<br/>
Brushed it well at early morning,<br/>
Laid it into laps for spinning<br/>
Quick the maidens twirl the spindles,<br/>
Spin the flaxen threads for weaving,<br/>
In a single night in summer.<br/>
Quick the sisters wind and reel it,<br/>
Make it ready for the needle.<br/>
Brothers weave it into fish-nets,<br/>
And the fathers twist the cordage,<br/>
While the mothers knit the meshes,<br/>
Rapidly the mesh-stick circles;<br/>
Soon the fish-net is completed,<br/>
In a single night in summer.<br/>
As the magic net is finished,<br/>
And in length a hundred fathoms,<br/>
On the rim three hundred fathoms.<br/>
Rounded stones are fastened to it,<br/>
Joined thereto are seven float-boards.<br/>
Now the young men take the fish-net,<br/>
And the old men cheer them onward,<br/>
Wish them good-luck at their fishing.<br/>
Long they row and drag the flax-seine,<br/>
Here and there the net is lowered;<br/>
Now they drag it lengthwise, sidewise,<br/>
Drag it through the slimy reed-beds;<br/>
But they do not catch the Fire-pike,<br/>
Only smelts, and luckless red-fish,<br/>
Little fish of little value.<br/>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br/>
“O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Let us go ourselves a-fishing,<br/>
Let us catch the fish of evil!”<br/>
To the fishing went the brothers,<br/>
Magic heroes of the Northland,<br/>
Pulled the fish-net through the waters,<br/>
Toward an island in the deep-sea<br/>
Then they turn and drag the fish-net<br/>
Toward a meadow jutting seaward;<br/>
Now they drag it toward Wainola,<br/>
Draw it lengthwise, sidewise, crosswise,<br/>
Catching fish of every species,<br/>
salmon, trout, and pike, and whiting,<br/>
Do not catch the evil Fire-fish.<br/>
Then the master, Wainamoinen,<br/>
Made additions to its borders,<br/>
Made it many fathoms wider,<br/>
And a hundred fathoms longer,<br/>
Then these words the hero uttered<br/>
“Famous blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Let us go again a-fishing,<br/>
Row again the magic fish-net,<br/>
Drag it well through all the waters,<br/>
That we may obtain the Fire-pike!”<br/>
Thereupon the Northland heroes<br/>
Go a second time a-fishing,<br/>
Drag their nets across the rivers,<br/>
Lakelets, seas, and bays, and inlets,<br/>
Catching fish of many species,<br/>
But the Fire-fish is not taken.<br/>
Wainamoinen, ancient singer,<br/>
Long reflecting, spake these measures:<br/>
“Dear Wellamo, water-hostess,<br/>
Ancient mother with the reed-breast,<br/>
Come, exchange thy water-raiment,<br/>
Change thy coat of reeds and rushes<br/>
For the garments I shall give thee,<br/>
Light sea-foam, thine inner vesture,<br/>
And thine outer, moss and sea-grass,<br/>
Fashioned by the wind’s fair daughters,<br/>
Woven by the flood’s sweet maidens;<br/>
I will give thee linen vestments<br/>
Spun from flax of softest fiber,<br/>
Woven by the Moon’s white virgins,<br/>
Fashioned by the Sun’s bright daughters<br/>
Fitting raiment for Wellamo!<br/>
“Ahto, king of all the waters,<br/>
Ruler of a thousand grottoes,<br/>
Take a pole of seven fathoms,<br/>
Search with this the deepest waters,<br/>
Rummage well the lowest bottoms;<br/>
Stir up all the reeds and sea-weeds,<br/>
Hither drive a school of gray-pike,<br/>
Drive them to our magic fish-net,<br/>
From the haunts in pike abounding,<br/>
From the caverns, and the trout-holes,<br/>
From the whirlpools of the deep-sea,<br/>
From the bottomless abysses,<br/>
Where the sunshine never enters,<br/>
Where the moonlight never visits,<br/>
And the sands are never troubled.”<br/>
Rose a pigmy from the waters,<br/>
From the floods a little hero,<br/>
Riding on a rolling billow,<br/>
And the pigmy spake these measures:<br/>
“Dost thou wish a worthy helper,<br/>
One to use the pole and frighten<br/>
Pike and salmon to thy fish-nets?”<br/>
Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<br/>
Answered thus the lake-born hero:<br/>
“Yea, we need a worthy helper,<br/>
One to hold the pole, and frighten<br/>
Pike and salmon to our fish-nets.”<br/>
Thereupon the water-pigmy<br/>
Cut a linden from the border,<br/>
Spake these words to Wainamoinen:<br/>
“Shall I scare with all my powers,<br/>
With the forces of my being,<br/>
As thou needest shall I scare them?”<br/>
Spake the minstrel, Wainamoinen:<br/>
“If thou scarest as is needed,<br/>
Thou wilt scare with all thy forces,<br/>
With the strength of thy dominions.”<br/>
Then began the pigmy-hero,<br/>
To affright the deep-sea-dwellers;<br/>
Drove the fish in countless numbers<br/>
To the net of the magicians.<br/>
Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br/>
Drew his net along the waters,<br/>
Drew it with his ropes of flax-thread,<br/>
Spake these words of magic import:<br/>
“Come ye fish of Northland waters<br/>
To the regions of my fish-net,<br/>
As my hundred meshes lower.”<br/>
Then the net was drawn and fastened,<br/>
Many were the gray-pike taken<br/>
By the master and magician.<br/>
Wainamoinen, happy-hearted,<br/>
Hastened to a neighboring island,<br/>
To a blue-point in the waters,<br/>
Near a red-bridge on the headland;<br/>
Landed there his draught of fishes,<br/>
Cast the pike upon the sea-shore,<br/>
And the Fire-pike was among them,<br/>
Cast the others to the waters.<br/>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br/>
“May I touch thee with my fingers,<br/>
Using not my gloves of iron,<br/>
Using not my blue-stone mittens?<br/>
This the Sun-child hears and answers:<br/>
“I should like to carve the Fire-fish,<br/>
I should like this pike to handle,<br/>
If I had the knife of good-luck.”<br/>
Quick a knife falls from the heavens,<br/>
From the clouds a magic fish-knife,<br/>
Silver-edged and golden-headed,<br/>
To the girdle of the Sun-child;<br/>
Quick he grasps the copper handle,<br/>
Quick the hero carves the Fire-pike,<br/>
Finds therein the tortured lake-trout;<br/>
Carves the lake-trout thus discovered.<br/>
Finds therein the fated whiting;<br/>
Carves the whiting, finds a blue-ball<br/>
In the third cave of his body.<br/>
He, the blue-ball quick unwinding,<br/>
Finds within a ball of scarlet;<br/>
Carefully removes the cover,<br/>
Finds the ball of fire within it,<br/>
Finds the flame from heaven fallen,<br/>
From the heights of the seventh heaven,<br/>
Through nine regions of the ether.<br/>
Wainamoinen long reflected<br/>
How to get the magic fire-ball<br/>
To Wainola’s fireless hearth-stones,<br/>
To his cold and cheerless dwellings.<br/>
Quick he snatched the fire of heaven<br/>
From the fingers of the Sun-child.<br/>
Wainamoinen’s beard it singes,<br/>
Burns the brow of Ilmarinen,<br/>
Burns the fingers of the blacksmith.<br/>
Rolling forth it hastens westward,<br/>
Hastens to the Alue shore-lines,<br/>
Burns the juniper and alder,<br/>
Burns the arid heath and meadow,<br/>
Rises to the lofty linden,<br/>
Burns the firs upon the mountains;<br/>
Hastens onward, onward, onward,<br/>
Burns the islands of the Northland,<br/>
Burns the Sawa fields and forests,<br/>
Burns the dry lands of Karyala.<br/>
Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br/>
Hastens through the fields and fenlands,<br/>
Tracks the ranger to the glen-wood,<br/>
Finds the Fire-child in an elm-tree,<br/>
Sleeping in a bed of fungus.<br/>
Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<br/>
Wakes the child and speaks these measures:<br/>
“Wicked fire that God created,<br/>
Flame of Ukko from the heavens,<br/>
Thou hast gone in vain to sea-caves,<br/>
To the lakes without a reason;<br/>
Better go thou to my village,<br/>
To the hearth-stones of my people;<br/>
Hide thyself within my chimneys,<br/>
In mine ashes sleep and linger.<br/>
In the day-time I will use thee<br/>
To devour the blocks of birch-wood;<br/>
In the evening I will hide thee<br/>
Underneath the golden circle.”<br/>
Then he took the willing Panu,<br/>
Took the willing fire of Ukko,<br/>
Laid it in a box of tinder,<br/>
In the punk-wood of a birch-tree,<br/>
In a vessel forged from copper;<br/>
Carried it with care and pleasure<br/>
To the fog-point in the waters,<br/>
To the island forest covered.<br/>
Thus returned the fire to Northland,<br/>
To the chambers of Wainola,<br/>
To the hearths of Kalevala.<br/>
Ilmarinen, famous blacksmith,<br/>
Hastened to the deep-sea’s margin,<br/>
Sat upon the rock of torture,<br/>
Feeling pain the flame had given,<br/>
Laved his wounds with briny water,<br/>
Thus to still the Fire-child’s fury,<br/>
Thus to end his persecutions.<br/>
Long reflecting, Ilmarinen<br/>
Thus addressed the flame of Ukko:<br/>
“Evil Panu from the heavens,<br/>
Wicked son of God from ether,<br/>
Tell me what has made thee angry,<br/>
Made thee burn my weary members,<br/>
Burn my beard, and face, and fingers,<br/>
Made me suffer death-land tortures?<br/>
Spake again young Ilmarinen:<br/>
“How can I wild Panu conquer,<br/>
How shall I control his conduct,<br/>
Make him end his evil doings?<br/>
Come, thou daughter from Pohyola,<br/>
Come, white virgin of the hoar-frost,<br/>
Come on shoes of ice from Lapland,<br/>
Icicles upon thy garments,<br/>
In one band a cup of white-frost,<br/>
In the other hand an ice-spoon;<br/>
Sprinkle snow upon my members,<br/>
Where the Fire-child has been resting,<br/>
Let the hoar-frost fall and settle.<br/>
“Should this prayer be unavailing,<br/>
Come, thou son of Sariola,<br/>
Come, thou child of Frost from Pohya,<br/>
Come, thou Long-man from the ice-plains,<br/>
Of the height of stately pine-trees,<br/>
Slender as the trunks of lindens,<br/>
On thy hands the gloves of Hoar-frost,<br/>
Cap of ice upon thy forehead,<br/>
On thy waist a white-frost girdle;<br/>
Bring the ice-dust from Pohyola,<br/>
From the cold and sunless village.<br/>
Rain is crystallized in Northland,<br/>
Ice in Pohya is abundant,<br/>
Lakes of ice and ice-bound rivers,<br/>
Frozen smooth, the sea of ether.<br/>
Bounds the hare in frosted fur-robe,<br/>
Climbs the bear in icy raiment,<br/>
Ambles o’er the snowy mountains.<br/>
Swans of frost descend the rivers,<br/>
Ducks of ice in countless numbers<br/>
Swim upon thy freezing waters,<br/>
Near the cataract and whirlpool.<br/>
Bring me frost upon thy snow-sledge,<br/>
Snow and ice in great abundance,<br/>
From the summit of the wild-top,<br/>
From the borders of the mountains.<br/>
With thine ice, and snow, and hoar-frost<br/>
Cover well mine injured members<br/>
Where wild Panu has been resting,<br/>
Where the child of Fire has lingered.<br/>
“Should this call be ineffective,<br/>
Ukko, God of love and mercy,<br/>
First and last of the creators,<br/>
From the east send forth a snow-cloud,<br/>
From the west despatch a second,<br/>
Join their edges well together,<br/>
Let there be no vacant places,<br/>
Let these clouds bring snow and<br/>
Lay the healing balm of Ukko<br/>
On my burning, tortured tissues,<br/>
Where wild Panu has been resting.”<br/>
Thus the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Stills the pains by fire engendered,<br/>
Stills the agonies and tortures<br/>
Brought him by the child of evil,<br/>
Brought him by the wicked Panu.</p>
